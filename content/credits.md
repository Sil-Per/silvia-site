I followed great suggestions received by [Matthew Flood](https://researchportal.lih.lu/en/persons/matthew-flood) and created this website with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/).
I worked with the [hugo-coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) theme, whose material I found wonderful.

For any suggestions, you find my institutional details [here](https://wwwen.uni.lu/research/fdef/dem/people/silvia_peracchi), on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silvia-peracchi-3a9655ba/), or to my e-mail address (silvia.peracchi.SP@gmail.com).
