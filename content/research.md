### Roads and food security in Sub-Saharan Africa
With Luisito Bertinelli, Evie Graus, Jean-Francois Maystadt.

This paper examines the impact of road access on food security in Sub-Saharan Africa from 1980 to 2012. Using geolocated data on child malnutrition and road networks, we assess the broader consequences of road infrastructure, balancing economic gains from accessibility against potential drawbacks such as ecological damage, land-use change, and dependence on external actors (e.g., pressure on smallholder farmers). To address endogeneity, we adopt an instrumental-variable approach, constructing fictitious road networks based on the inconsequential units framework. Our findings indicate that the benefits of roads outweigh their costs: proximity to paved roads significantly improves food security for young children. The main mechanisms are increases in healthcare utilization, household wealth, and cropland area, while market expansion points to the early stages of structural transformation.

### Civil War Driven Trade Shocks and Their Footprint: Roads, Pollution, and Development in West Africa
With Evie Graus

This paper looks shifts in trade transits in West Africa, resulting from Ivory Coast's civil war in the 2000. Coastal countries in the region compete to attract the flow of goods from landlocked countries to their ports. With an internal civil war disrupting access to Ivory Coast's port of Abidjan, we study this event as a quasi-natural experiment that affected Ivory Coast's neighboring coastal countries. In particular, these redirected flows likely effected well-connected areas with international roads leading to ports. We use road proximity and measures of network centrality in a diff-in-diff setting, to study the effect of surging transit on population density and built-up areas. We also explore whether pollution grows, as a side effect. Preliminary findings suggest an heterogeneous impact across countries.

### Understanding the drivers of Cross-border mobility 
With Frédéric Docquier and Vincent Dautel

First work package of the project CRoss-border mobility, HOUSing market developments, and IneQualities [(CROHOUSINQ)](https://liser.elsevierpure.com/en/projects/cross-border-mobility-housing-market-developments-and-inequalitie)

In this study, we look into key forces that shape the joint decision of workers on where to live and where to work. We focus on the context of cross-border work in Luxembourg or France, using detailed data on French-Born individuals from Grand-Est. We investigate and simulate how economic shocks, especially from the labor and housing markets, influence these decisions at different education levels.



## Working papers 
### Migrants’ crisis in the local news: evidence from the French-Italian border.
* (Job market paper, conditionally accepted at __Journal of Urban Economics__)  Peracchi, Silvia, The Migration Crisis in the Local News: Evidence from the French-Italian Border CESifo Working Paper No. 10070, Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4273444 or [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4273444). 

This paper investigates the impact of local exposure to migration crisis events on the local news market. Exploiting a local setting, this study explores a policy dating June 2015, whereby French authorities introduced militarized controls at the Italian frontier.
This resulted into a consistent push-back of the irregular crossings of migrants and asylum seekers to the Italian land. Combining text-analysis tools with a quasi-experimental setting, this study documents that the presence of migrants in the Italian border area was mediatically important. Yet, media slant towards anti-immigrant discourse is found to rise relatively more in the areas least directly involved by the border controls. This bias-effect is found to be driven by a demand-push for ideology in the news. Finally, slant and voting preferences share the same broad direction, and a similar pattern is also reflected in hate-crime records.

### International drivers of immigration policies. 
* With Dr. Melissa Tornari.
Stage of the paper: draft available on demand. 

This paper aims at assessing the international dimension of a country’s asylum policy decisions in Europe. In this context, countries’ choices may depend not only on own characteristics, but also on the decisions and characteristics of connected countries. We explore
these patterns via a flexible econometric model which allows for both spatial and temporal dynamics. The paper contribute to the existing literature by proposing estimates that allow to capture spillovers, as well as
feedback-effects, along various dimensions of proximity. We find evidence that countries’ acceptance rates and processing times do depend on the choices of their neighbors, and that Germany’s open-door policy
announcement induced some spillover effects.
