Hi! Thanks for visiting my personal page. 

I am PhD from the [University of Luxembourg](https://wwwen.uni.lu/research/fdef/dem/people/silvia_peracchi). In 2023 I will be a postdoctoral researcher at the Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research (LISER), where I'll be working on cross-border mobility.

My doctoral research was part of the Doctoral Training Unit on Migration, Inequalities and Labour Markets [MINLAB](https://wwwen.uni.lu/research/fdef/dem/dtu_projects/dtu_minlab), an FNR funded research program involving applied socio-economic research on issues around migration, labour markets and inequalities.



## Research interests:

- Migration Economics.
- Applied econometrics, methods for causal inference.
- Spatial data.
- Natural language processing.
- Asylum migration.
- Migration policies in Europe.
