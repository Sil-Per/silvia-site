# silvia-site

This material relates to my personal website creation.
You can find it at the link:
https://silvia-peracchi-econ.netlify.app/.


## Details and sources:
To build my website, I made use of the following resources:

- [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/): a framework that eases static website generation, with the help of user written [themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/).
I worked with the [hugo-coder theme](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder).

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/): a website that handles the deployment of the website, interacting with data stored on github in a very simple way.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): open-source code editor that allows me to easily edit my lines of code across different files.



This is the first website creation for me following these approached. 
For those in my conditions I strongly recommend this nice [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjD9jTi_DQ4), which I found of great help for my purpose.
