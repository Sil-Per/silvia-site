Hi! Thanks for visiting my personal page. 

I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of Economics and Social Research (IRES) of [UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/lidam/ires). Prior to this, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research ([LISER](https://www.liser.lu/)). I obtained my PhD in Economics at the University of Luxembourg in November 2022.

During my PhD, my research centered on migration economics under the guidance of Professor [Michel Beine](https://sites.google.com/site/michelbeineeconomics/home).
Currently, I conduct research in both migration and development economics, and I am collaborating with [Jean-Fran√ßois Maystadt](https://jmaystadt.wixsite.com/website) and [Luisito Bertinelli](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=utBgyekAAAAJ&hl=en) on the project ``[Road to Sustainable Development in SSA](https://jmaystadt.wixsite.com/website/blank-page-1)''.



## Research interests:

- Migration Economics.
- Applied econometrics, methods for causal inference.
- Spatial data.
- Natural language processing.
- Asylum migration.
- Migration policies in Europe.
