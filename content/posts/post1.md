# Introduction
In the third chapter of my thesis, I investigated whether the reception decisions of countries facing asylum seekers applications was interdependent with the decisions of their neighboring governments. 

While my paper focuses on asylum migration, I came across several contributions that collected data on national policies on migration.
Here you may find the list with some details.
