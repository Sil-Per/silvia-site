### Genetic diversity and performance: evidence from football data.
* With Prof. Dr. Michel Beine and Prof. Dr. Skerdilajda Zanaj. 
Stage of the paper: Discussion paper [available here](https://www.cesifo.org/en/publikationen/2021/working-paper/genetic-diversity-and-performance-evidence-fooball-data). 

In this paper, we investigate and find evidence of a causal link between the diversity of sports teams and their performance, in football. The study relies on a
novel dataset of national football teams of European countries participating in the EUROs and the World Cup, in the qualification and the final stages, from 1970 to 2018. We make use of an algorithm to predict the players’ origins based on their surnames and allow for an asymmetric measure of diversity in the players’ origins with the use of genetic distance matrices.


### Migrants’ crisis in the local news: evidence from the French-Italian border.
* (Job market paper) Stage of the paper: Working paper on demand. 
This paper investigates the impact of local exposure to migration crisis events on the local news market. Exploiting a local setting, this study explores a policy dating June 2015, whereby French authorities introduced militarized controls at the Italian frontier.
This resulted into a consistent push-back of the irregular crossings of migrants and asylum seekers to the Italian land. Combining text-analysis tools with a quasi-experimental setting, this study documents that the presence of migrants in the Italian border area was mediatically important. Yet, media slant towards anti-immigrant discourse is found to rise relatively more in the areas least directly involved by the border controls. This bias-effect is found to be driven by a demand-push for ideology in the news. Finally, slant and voting preferences share the same broad direction, and a similar pattern is also reflected in hate-crime records.

### International drivers of immigration policies. 
* With Dr. Melissa Tornari.
Stage of the paper: preliminary draft available on demand. This paper aims at assessing the international dimension of a country’s asylum policy decisions in Europe. In this context, countries’ choices may depend not only on own characteristics, but also on the decisions and characteristics of connected countries. We explore
these patterns via a flexible econometric model which allows for both spatial and temporal dynamics. The paper contribute to the existing literature by proposing estimates that allow to capture spillovers, as well as
feedback-effects, along various dimensions of proximity. We find evidence that countries’ acceptance rates and processing times do depend on the choices of their neighbors, and that Germany’s open-door policy
announcement induced some spillover effects.
