GOOD TIPS R 

Loops vs functions and parallelization.
In quite a few occasions we can replace loops with functions to get faster; 
In R we can use lapply, sapply, or even launch a parallel process (e.g. future and furrr packages). 
Same for python.
In STATA, we can also create "functions", which are called "programs". They can be stored as .ado files but can also be written on a .do file.
 
-Example: recalibrate_constants.ado. I Stata, you can use the package "parallel"
You can parallelize programs (and bootstrap routines). 

Shortcut 
“Ctrl+Shift+A”: good alignment
“Ctrl+Shift+C”: comment and un-comment lines of code
“Ctrl+Shift+F10”: restart R session
